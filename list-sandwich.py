'''
Given two lists of integers A, B, we define the sandwich of A and B
as the list resulting from concatenating B to A, then A to the previous
result, "sandwiching" one B between two As.

Example 1:
A = [1,2,3], B =[7,7,7,7]
sandwich of A and B = [1,2,3,7,7,7,7,1,2,3]

Example 2:
A = [1], B =[43, 1]
sandwich of A and B = [1, 43, 1, 1]

Example 2:
A = [], B =[10,8,6]
sandwich of A and B = [10, 8, 6]
