'''
You are given two sentences, A and B. Your job is to write a function
called addlength that returns the length of the string resulting from
the concatenation of A and B.

Example 1:
A="the ", B="best"
output = 8
Explanation: (A and B concatenated is "the best", which has 8 characters,
including space " ")

Example 2:
A="", B="tables"
output = 6

NOTE: there are two different ways to write addlength.
See if you can find both ways.

HINT: remember to return the length of the string, not the string itself.
HINT: the len() function returns the length of a sequence
