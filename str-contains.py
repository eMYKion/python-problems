'''
You are writing a function called contains(), which takes as input a sentence
and a word (both strings), and returns True if the sentence has that word,
else False.

Begin writing after the comment #YOUR CODE HERE.
Remember to replace "None" with your answer (variables, expressions),
for example: "return my_variable" instead of "return None"

HINT: Your code should use the "in" keyword (lesson 2, slide 35).
HINT: It is possible to solve the problem in one line.
