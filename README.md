# Python Problems

Problems are in the top-level directory `python-problems`.
The `test/` directory has the testing code.

First, solve a problem by completing the python code (e.g. `PROBLEM.py`).

To check your solution with our test cases, run the corresponding
test file in `test/`. For example, to check your solution of `PROBLEM.py`,
go to `test/` and run `PROBLEM.py`.

```
$ cd test/
$ python3 PROBLEM.py
```

To write your own test cases, follow `test/_template.py`.
