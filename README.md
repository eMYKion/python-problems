# Python Problems
These problems are created for the 'Problem Solving with Python' Summer 2023 tutoring.

Problems are in the top-level directory `python-problems` as files (e.g. `bool-simplify.py`).
The `test/` directory has the test cases. There is an additional `project/` directory with an 
incomplete game of Tic-Tac-Toe as a final challenge.

## Setup
You will need a computer with a Terminal/Command-line application.

Download and install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need a file editor (e.g. vim, emacs, IDLE, notepad++, notepad, etc.).

Then, `git clone` (or download) this repository to your local computer. In Terminal, enter:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/eMYKion/python-problems.git
```
(Remember to omit the `$`)

## Solving and testing
Then, "solve" a problem by choosing a problem python file (e.g. `bool-simplify.py`), reading the instructions inside, and editing the file (which usually involves writing a few lines of code). After editing, this code is your "solution."

After editing and saving the file (say, `YOUR-PROBLEM.py`), check your solution code against the test cases: 
1. Navigate to the location of your local `python-problems/` folder in Terminal (if not already).
2. Test your solution by running `test.py` in the terminal as follows: `$ python3 -B test.py YOUR-PROBLEM.py` (omit the `$`).

If your code fails any of the test cases, re-edit and re-test the file until your code passes all of the test-cases.

Happy solving!
