# Python Problems

Problems are in the top-level directory `python-problems`.
The `test/` directory has the test cases.

First, solve a problem `YOUR-PROBLEM.py` in a python file (e.g. `bool-simplify.py`).

To check your solution with our test cases, run `test.py` in the terminal as
follows:

```
$ python3 test.py YOUR-PROBLEM.py
```
