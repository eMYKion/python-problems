'''
After Halloween, you are given a bag of candy as a list of words
(list of strings) that may contain repeats of certain candy brands.

Ex. bag = ["M&Ms", "Skittles", "M&Ms", "Starburst", "Starburst"]

Given bag count_candies returns a dictionary
that maps candy names to an integer count of how many there are
in the bag.

Example:
bag = ["M&Ms", "Skittles", "M&Ms", "Starburst", "Starburst"]
output = {
    "M&Ms": 2,
    "Skittles": 1,
    "Starburst": 2,
}

HINT: write "pseudocode" on paper first!
HINT: for-loop
