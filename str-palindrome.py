'''
A palindrome is a string that is the same forward as it is backward.

Examples:
"" is a palindrome
"a" is a palindrome
"aba" is a palindrome
"axaxa" is a palindrome
"abac" is NOT a palindrome

Write a function is_palindrome that takes a string s and returns True
if and only if s is a palindrome.

    return is_palindrome(*args)
