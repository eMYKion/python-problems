'''
Because this is a large project, we will complete the project in
parts. Each lesson leading to the final tic-tac-toe game will
make the game MORE complete. 

FIRST read a description of the game in the file INTRO.txt,
and make sure you understand the overall game and terminology we
will use. THEN, proceed with this file.

============ THE CODE ============

Our main data structure will be a 2D list:
BOARD = [
    ['1', '2', '3'],
    ['4', '5', '6'],
    ['7', '8', '9'],
]

This 2D 3x3 list-of-lists that represents the state of the game by
storing the 'markings' on each of the 9 positions.

The elements are strings (single characters) and represent either:
    (a.) An empty, unmarked position
        (Any number as a string from '1' to '9')
    (b.) A marking from player X (an 'X')
    (c.) A marking from player O (an 'O')

The main() function is the, well, main function of the game!
It runs a game loop that terminates when there is a winner or a tie.
For each loop, it alternates asking player X and player O to enter
an integer representing one of the unmarked positions in the board.
==================================


============ # TODO 0 ============
Explore the code at the code in the main() function,
until you can answer the following questions (based on the
code):
1. Under what condition does the game end?
2. What step(s) are "missing" from our
main() function to run the game correctly?
    (HINT: Who wins?, how do we mark the board?)
==================================

============ # TODO 1 ============
Complete (get_current_player) that returns 'X' when
it is player X's turn (when turn is even) and
returns 'O' when it is player 'O's turn.
==================================

============ # TODO 2 ============
Note that we can also 'flatten' the board
from 2D format to 1D format. The 2D format
will help in checking winners, and the 1D
format will help in formatted printing.

       2D                                    1D
[
    ['1', '2', '3'],     flattened
    ['4', '5', '6'],     ======>   ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']    
    ['7', '8', '9'],
]

Complete the (flatten) function to turn any 2D board into a 1D board.
Once finished, read the print_board function to see how it uses flatten.
==================================


============ # TODO 3 ============
Complete the function (is_unmarked). Given a 2D 3x3 board (board_2d) and a
position from 1-9 (pos) return True if position (pos) of (board_2d) is
currently unmarked, else False.

HINT: What function you just wrote turns a 2D board into a 1D board?
HINT: What conditions do we need to check that a board position is unmarked?
    Check out the str.isdigit() method on the web.
    Or in IDLE:    
    >>> d = '4'
    >>> d.isdigit()
    True
    >>> 'X'.isdigit()
    False
    
HINT: Given a position (pos), the index at that position is (pos - 1)
(after appropriately converting str to int) as shown in the figure below:

(flattened empty board) ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']

                (index)   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8

==================================

Once you are finished with TODOs 0,1,2 and 3, use the following command
in freshly opened terminal to run the incomplete game:

cd python-problems/project
python3 -B ttt.py

What appears to be missing from the game so far?
